## Technologies Used

- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
- Python (with Pandas, Matplotlib, or Seaborn for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive analysis)

## Data Sources

- The dataset is located in the `data` folder. It consists of:
  - `sales_data.csv` – records of sales transactions.
  - `music_tracks.csv` – information about music tracks, including artist and genre.
  - `customers.csv` – details of customers who made purchases.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/sql-music-store-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd sql-music-store-analysis
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   - Create a new SQL database using your preferred database management system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
   - Import the CSV files into your database using commands or tools specific to your setup:
     - For MySQL:
       ```sql
       LOAD DATA INFILE 'path/to/sales_data.csv' INTO TABLE sales FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
       ```

4. **Install Python dependencies (if using Python):**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Analysis Objectives

The main analysis goals include:
- Understanding overall sales trends over different periods.
- Identifying the most popular artists and genres.
- Analyzing customer purchase behavior and identifying the most frequent buyers.

## Sample Queries

Here are some SQL queries used in the analysis:

1. **Total sales by date:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales, sale_date
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY sale_date
   ORDER BY sale_date;
   ```

2. **Top 10 most popular genres:**
   ```sql
   SELECT genre, COUNT(*) AS genre_count
   FROM music_tracks
   GROUP BY genre
   ORDER BY genre_count DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Customer purchase frequency:**
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY customer_id
   ORDER BY purchase_count DESC;
   ```

## Results & Findings

(Provide a summary of the key findings from your analysis here, including insights, charts, and tables as needed.)

## Future Work

- Further analysis on seasonal trends in sales.
- Implementing data visualization dashboards for real-time insights.
- Enhancing the database schema by adding more attributes or relationships.
